# Image-Classification

Traffic congestion seems to be at an all-time high. Machine Learning methods must be developed to help solve traffic problems. In this assignment, you will analyze features extracted from traffic images depicting different objects to determine their type as one of 11 classes, noted by integers 1-11: car, suv, small_truck, medium_truck, large_truck, pedestrian, bus, van, people, bicycle, and motorcycle. The object classes are heavily imbalanced. For example, the training data contains 10375 cars but only 3 bicycles and 0 people. Classes in the test data are similarly distributed.
