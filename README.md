# Image-Classification

Traffic congestion seems to be at an all-time high. Machine Learning methods must be developed to help solve traffic problems. In this project, we analyze features extracted from traffic images depicting different objects to determine their type as one of 11 classes, noted by integers 1-11: car, suv, small_truck, medium_truck, large_truck, pedestrian, bus, van, people, bicycle, and motorcycle.
